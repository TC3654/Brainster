    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most (ab)used facts in statistics. Sometimes it is called **the fundamental theorem of statistics** (in analogy to similar theorems in arithmetic, algebra, and calculus)\n",

    "In simple terms, the CLT states that if you have a random variable $X$ with mean $\\mu_X$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_X$, and you draw many samples of size $n$ from $X$, then the averages of those samples are described by a random variable, labeled as $\\overline{X}$, for which:\n",

    "\n",
    "Even more, the shape of the distribution is **approximately** Normal, or in other words $\\overline{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_\\overline{X}, \\sigma_\\overline{X}  \\right) = \\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu, \\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$. This distribution is called the **sampling distribution of the mean**.\n",

    "### How does this help us with data?\n",
    "The situation is as following: we have one sample of size $n$ from a population with unknown population mean $\\mu$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma$. Obviously, the *sample statistics* $\\bar{x}$ and $s$ can estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, but they can also \"miss\" them by a lot. These sample statistics are called **point estimates** of the population parameters.\n",

However, in all other cases, the Student *t*-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom describes the sampling distibution much better than the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the **68-95-99.7 Rule** for the Normal distribution. We can constuct something like that for any distribution. Since we only have one sample in reality, we use the sample statistics as estimates of the population parameters.

The number $df \\ n-1$ is the number of **degrees of freedom**, while the quantity $SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ is called **standard error**. Let's see some examples. The number $(1-\\alpha)\\%$ is called **confidence level** and usually is at least 90%.\n",
