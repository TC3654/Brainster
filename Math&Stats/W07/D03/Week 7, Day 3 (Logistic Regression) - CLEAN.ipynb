    "Unlike the linear and nonlinear regression models which return predicted values in infinite intervals (at least in theory), the logistic regression is set up in such a way that it returns values in the interval $(0, 1)$, regardles of the size of the inputs. This makes the logistic model a great candidate for application in **classification problems** where the outcome is a categorical variable.\n",
